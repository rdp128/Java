A string array is given containing the addresses of sites accessed, each string consisting IP addresses in the beginning followed by a space and then the complete address. Write a function that returns a string containing only the IP address(es) which were accessed maximum number of times.
Example:
Scenario 1-
Input : {“10.0.1.45 -/d/in/intheclass”,”10.0.1.45 -/a/facts/final…/bhgahf”,”10.3.54.123 -/d/xyz/bcc/yes”}
Output :”10.0.1.45”

Scenario 2-
Input : {“10.0.1.45 -/d/intheclass”,”10.0.1.45 -/a/facts/final…/bhgahf”,”10.45.23.34 -/x/new/car/honda”,”10.3.54.123 -/d/random/city/lucknow” ,”10.3.54.123 -/d/rich/family/do”}

Write a function that returns the first non-repeating character in String.
Example 1:
Input : ”apple”
Output: ‘a’

Input : “papaya”
Output: ‘y’
Questions asked: What is the default value can be returned if all the characters are repeating.
What are all the corner test cases can be added.

Given a string, write a program to check if it is palindrome or not. A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string. For example, “abba” is palindrome, but “abbc” is not palindrome.



Given a string check if it is Pangram or not. A pangram is a sentence containing every letter in the English Alphabet.

Examples : The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog ” is a Pangram [Contains all the characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’]
“The quick brown fox jumps over the dog” is not a Pangram [Doesn’t contains all the characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, as ‘l’, ‘z’, ‘y’ are missing]



Given a String find the characters(From A-Z) which are not present in that string in alphabetical order



Write a program to reverse letters in a string?/ Reverse the string of characters without using a built in function
input : saabbs
output :sbbaas



For a string input the function returns output encoded as follows:
Input "" Output ""
Input a Output a1
Input aa Output a2
Input aabb Output a2b2
Input aaabb Output a3b2

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 . . .
Given a specific number in this series Fn, your program needs to find the sum of all the numbers in the Fibonacci series that are smaller or equal to that number
Input - 8
Output: 20 (Sum of the numbers less than 8 in the fibonacci series. 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8)

To find the number of steps to complete a ‘cycle’ in an array, given the starting index. The value of the element present in the given index would give you the next index and so on, once to come back to the same position, it is said to have completed a cycle. For example, if the array is- {2,4,1,0,5,3 } and the starting index is 0, the number of steps to complete the cycle would be 5.

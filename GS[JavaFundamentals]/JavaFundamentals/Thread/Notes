
Important notes on MultiThreading
---------------------------------

-Thread is a separate flow of execution. 
-Every thread has a task. 
-It's independent.

Two type multitasking in JAVA
i)Process based 
 e.g. : - you open Chrome, calculator, MS Word, VLC player at the same time.
 
 
ii)Thread based (MultiThread)
 e.g. : - you open MS Word there -you typing --> one thread handling that
 								 -checking for spelling mistake --> second thread handling that

 ==>Creating thread 
 ------------------
 1)Using extending thread class
   -check creatingThread_1.java
   
   WHY THREAD CLASS start() method invoked?
   -it's responsible to register thread with thread scheduler and all other mandatory activity hence without executing 
    thread class start() method there is no chance of starting thread in java due to this, it's consider heart of multi thread.
   
   RULE:
   -when you overload run() method only without arguments run() method works in multi thread.
   -you only have to wtire(override) run method when you extends Thread class if you use other name then run() it's not works.
   -order of executing thread is unknown.
   -Don't override start() method if you do then your thread is not running mean multi thread concept is not works.
   -if we restart same thread again then we got error
   
 2)Implementing Runnable    
 	-it's in java.lang package
 	-it contains only one method public  abstract void run() method
 
 ==>Which one is Better?
  -Implementing Runnable  is better because if we have another class we can extends it or if we have another interface we can use it as well
   but by extending thread method we can't do that because java doen't support mulitple inheritance
    
******************************************************  
 ==>Thread Class Constructor:
   
   1)Thread(): Thread t = new Thread();
   2)Thread(Runable Target): 
     - MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
     - Thread t = new Thread(myThread)
     - Thread(String name): Thread t = new Thread("Rohan Thread")
       e.g. check ThreadConstructor.java
       -To provide our thread name we use this
     
   
******************************************************  
  ==>Important method of Thread
    1)void start() : To start thread and call run method inside your thread class
    
    2)Static Thread currentThread() :it returns reference to currently executing thread object. In short return thread name,thread priority, thread group
      e.g System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
      
    3)String getName() - return name of thread 
    e.g. System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    
    4)String setName() - change name
   
    
******************************************************  
  ==>Thread Priority 
    -it's determine how thread should be treated with respect to each other
    -valid range 1-10. 1-Minimum 10-Maximum
     Thread.MIN_PRIORITY -1
     Thread.NORM_PRIORITY - 5
     Thread.MAX_PRIORITY - 10
     
     Main Thread Priority - 5 
    
   
******************************************************   
  ==>yield() Method
	- it used to pause temporarily to currently executing thread and allow other 
	  waiting thread to execute.
	  
	-if we have too many thread and one thread took 10 hour to complete then other have to wait for their turn and execute so if we use 
	 yield() method then 10 hours thread pause and allow other thread to execute first. But this is not supported by all paltform
	 
  ==>join() method
    -if thread want to wait until completing some other thread then we used it.
    -we have to handle intrreptedException using try/catch or throws keyword
    
  
  
  ==>sleep() method	   
    -it use to sleep temporarily to currently executing thread for specific number of seconds
   
  ==>interrupt() method
    -A thread can interrupt a sleeping thread or waiting thread by using interrupt() method of thread class
    	 
   
******************************************************
   ==>Deadlock: When two thread are waiting for each other for infinite period of time then deadlock occur.
    -join method when child class wait for main thread and main thread wait for child class then this happen e.g. JoinMethod.java & JoinMethod_1.java
    -when main class wait for main class(itself) to finish it.

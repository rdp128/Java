
Important notes on MultiThreading
---------------------------------

-Thread is a separate flow of execution. 
-Every thread has a task. 
-It's independent.

Two type multitasking in JAVA
i)Process based 
 e.g. : - you open Chrome, calculator, MS Word, VLC player at the same time.
 
 
ii)Thread based (MultiThread)
 e.g. : - you open MS Word there -you typing --> one thread handling that
 								 -checking for spelling mistake --> second thread handling that
 					
 Creating thread 
 ---------------
 1)Using extending thread class
   -check creatingThread_1.java
   
   WHY THREAD CLASS start() method invoked?
   -it's responsible to register thread with thread scheduler and all other mandatory activity hence without executing 
    thread class start() method there is no chance of starting thread in java due to this, it's consider heart of multi thread.
   
   RULE:
   -when you overload run() method only without arguments run() method works in multi thread.
   -you only have to wtire(override) run method when you extends Thread class if you use other name then run() it's not works.
   -order of executing thread is unknown.
   -Don't override start() method if you do then your thread is not running mean multi thread concept is not works.

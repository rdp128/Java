Exception:An Exception is considered as problem, which stops program execution 
from continuation from the point of occurrence of it.

*******************
Why Exception Occur?
-User error : Wrong user input i.e.Number divide by 0
-programmer error: ArrayOutOfBound i.e. array size is 10 and try to add more than 10 element.
-Resources error: File not exists.

What is Exception Handling: It is a mechanism to handle run time error.

Advantage: Maintain the normal flow of program.(After exception occur rest of your code will execute.)
           Meaningful error reporting. (It will give you idea of what error is occur)

Disadvantage: Your program will crash.

Exception Hierarchy : https://www.benchresources.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exception-hierarchy-in-java.png

Checked Exception(Compile time exception)  ==> Always have to handle it 

    example: IOEXception(FileNOtFoundException), SQLException

UnChecked Exception(Runtime Exception) ==> not worry about it to  handle it 
    example: NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, StringINdexOutOfBoundsExceptions)

*******************

--->>Throw Keyword 
	-throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.
	-we can either throw checked or unchecked exceptions.
	-it mainly used to throw user define exception.
	-only throwable exception we can throw using throw keyword
	
	-Programmer is creating exception object and hand over  to JVM
	
	Syntax:
		  
		throw new AirthmeticException("Not Allowed");
		  |   -----Creating Exception Object-------
		  |
		--Using throw keyword programmer hand over exception  object to JVM
		
	NOTE: i)When you have Unchecked(RunTime) Exception you don't need to worry about to handled it
	        for e.g. public class Test {

						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							int a = 10/0;
							throw new ArithmeticException("Not Possible");//this is Unchecked Exception so it's okay if you don't handled it just throw it
						}
					}
		  ii)When you have Checked(CompileTime) Exception you have 2 Options
		     
		     for e.g. public class Test {

						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							int a = 10/0;
							throw new Exception("Not Possible");//Compile Error because it's Checked Exception
						}
					}
			 1) See below code  (Add throws mean declare it that you throwing checked Exception)
			 	public class Test {

					public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
					{
						int a = 10/0;
						throw new Exception("Not Possible");//Compile Error because Checked Exception
					}
				}
			 
		     2)	See below Code(Put try/catch block)
		        public class Test {

					public static void main(String[] args)
					{
						int a = 10/0;
						try
						{
							throw new Exception("Not Possible");
						} catch (Exception e) 
						{
							e.printStackTrace();
						}
					}
				}
	     	
*******************
		
--->>Throws Keyword 
 	-it roughly mean that give responsibility to other class to handle exception(e.g Owner>>Manager>>TeamLeader>>Member)		 
	-used for method, constructors not for classes
	-mainly used to handle checked exception if used it with unchecked ex there is no impact
	
	throw    								vs.					throws
1)It used to explicitly throw an exception	 |    1)It used to declare an Exception
2)throw use within the method				 |    2)throws used with method signature
3)you can not throw multiple exceptions.     |    3)you can declare nultiple exception
											 |	   i.e - public void method()thoew IOException, SQLException

*******************												   
User Define Exception:
-need to inherit Exception class in order to act as eception.
-throw keyword used to throw this kind of exception

class MyException extends Exception/RuntimeEsception
{

}

-Any class which extends Exception will be user define Checked exception class
-Any class which extends RuntimeException will be user define  RuntimeException class

Please check - ExceptionHandling_1.java and UserDefineCheckedException.java
